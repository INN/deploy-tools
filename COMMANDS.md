## WordPress utilities

### General WordPress utilities

#### wp.fetch\_sql\_dump

Fetches a recent database dump from WPEngine and saves it as `mysql.sql` in the root of your project directory.

#### wp.install:version

Downloads specified version of WordPress from https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress and installs it.

**version** -- *Required.* A version number to install (e.g. "3.9.1").

#### wp.verify_prerequisites

Checks to make sure you have curl (with ssh) and git-ftp installed, Attempts installation via brew if you do not.

### Maintenance mode commands

#### wp.maintenance.start

Prevents users from logging into the WordPress dashboard by modifying your project's `.htaccess` file on the specified environment.

#### wp.maintenance.stop

Removes the barrier put in place by `wp.maintenance.start`.

#### wp.cmd:cmd_slug,json_data=None|output=None

**cmd_slug** -- *Required.* Your script/command slug.

**json_data** -- Path to json file with data to be sent over the wire to your script/command.

**output** -- Location to save any response content return by the script/command.

Run an admin/management script hosted on your WP Engine install.

This command looks for a PHP file in the `/wp-scripts/` path of your install.

For example:

    fab staging wp.cmd:menus_dump,blog_id=64

Makes an HTTP request to your staging environment for `/wp-scripts/menus_dump.php`.

See the [wp-scripts](https://github.com/INN/wp-scripts) repository for a sampling of scripts/commands.

You can save the output from your scripts/commands to a local file with the `output` argument.

For example:

    fab production wp.cmd:menus_dump,blog_id=64,output=data/blog_64_menus.json

You can send JSON data over the wire using the `json_data` argument.

For example:

    fab staging wp.cmd:menus_load,blog_id=64,json_data=data/blog_64_menus.json

### Unit test scaffolding and test runner for plugins and themes

#### wp.tests.setup:theme_or_plugin

Generates files need to run PHPUnit tests for a plugin or theme included in your project.

**theme_or_plugin** -- *Required* The directory name of the plugin or theme to generate test files for.

#### wp.tests.run:theme_or_plugin

**theme_or_plugin** -- *Required* The directory name of the plugin or theme to run tests for.

## General utilities

#### rollback

#### helpers.search\_replace:file,search,replacement

**search** -- *Required.* A string to search for in the file. For example: "largoproject.org"
